# Edgenuity-Master-Controller
A user script to make Edgenuity more better for us students.  

Most of the credit goes to [Edgenuity Master Controller v0.4](https://github.com/XANADryden/Edgenuity-Master-Controller). I just took their version and added a lot more features.

## Installation

First, install Tampermonkey or another similar userscript extension.  Next, click on it in the extension list.  On Chrome you may need to press the puzzle piece first, and on Firefox you may need to press the double arrows.  Select Tampermonkey or your prefered extension, then choose Create new script.  Now clear everything out of the file that pops up, and paste in the contents of the Edgenuity_Master_Controllerv0.5.user.js file.  Now hit file>save, or press CTRL+S.  Make sure the script is enabled, and refresh edgenuity if it's already open.
