# UPDATE #

I am no longer working on this project since I am done with edgenuity, if you want the maintained version, head over to https://github.com/diorisdash/assnuity and check both releases and main.


# Edgenuity-Master-Controller
A user script to make Edgenuity more better for us students.  

Most of the credit goes to [Edgenuity Master Controller v0.4](https://github.com/XANADryden/Edgenuity-Master-Controller). I just took their version and added a lot more features.

If you want to contribute, just make a pull request.

## Installation

First, install Tampermonkey or another similar userscript extension.  Next, click on the edgenuity-master-controller user.js file, then click on raw, you will have the option & ability to install it. When you then go to edgenuity, make sure that it is set to on for both tampermonkey & the userscript. Thats it!
